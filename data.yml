        Graduated with my PhD, I can adapt to many situations and technologies. I have mostly worked
        on projects and proofs of concept in the Human Computer Interaction field (HCI) such as:
        force based techniques to control autoscroll speed on iOS devices and desktop computers,
        latency compensation techniques on desktop computers using a hardware customized mouse and on mobile devices
        through software compensation techniques within Chromium and 3D staging techniques
        to ease the production of vector-based illustrations in Blender."
